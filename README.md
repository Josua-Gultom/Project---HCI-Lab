# Project---HCI-Lab
This website is an e-commerce motorcycle made in groups. The features available on this website are Home, Product, Reserve and Gallery. The programming languages used are html, css, and javascript. Meanwhile, I created a database based on the case given by binus, which was worked as a team and myself.
